# Master-Scriptie-CBS
On this GitHub page, I share my code that I used for my master thesis at CBS for Statistics and Data Science. The thesis is split up into three projects: Research Part 1, 2 and 3. Each of these parts belong to one of the analysis that I performed and corresponding to my report. I also have a code title "Dataset creation" in which datasets are created that I lated used to run the models in Part 2 and 3. 
I give a short description of each code section on what the goal was of the research part and what the main focus was. In the code itself, I explain in detail what each chunk means and guide the reader thought the whole process.
